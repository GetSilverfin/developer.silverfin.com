<h1>The silverfin templating language</h1>

The silverfin templating language (STL) is based upon the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid">liquid shopify language</a>. Although there are a lot of similarities. Some functions in the liquid shopify language are not possible in the silverfin templating language and vice versa.

STL is used to make or adjust templates within the <a href="https://live.getsilverfin.com/">silverfin platform</a>. The silverfin platform is a cloud-based platform of the <a href="http://silverfin.com/">Silverfin</a> company and is used for connected accounting.
